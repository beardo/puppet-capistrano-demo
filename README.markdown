## Deploying Rails projects with Puppet and Capistrano

This is an example project showing how to deploy a rails project with puppet and capistrano.
It's still currently in progress and I'm only pushing to github right now because I need
it there to test the capistrano deploy part of things so sorry about the sparse
documentation at the moment. Hopefully there will be more tomorrow.
